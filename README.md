# Hacknite23 - Team Segmentation Fault

Aim: Our goal was to develop an IPL data analysis application that can provide valuable insights into player performance and team selection. The application generates the following outputs:

  1) Best Playing XI (Team-wise): The application will analyze the performance of players in a specific team for a particular year and generate a recommendation for the best playing XI for that team. The output will be based on various performance metrics such as batting average, bowling average, strike rate, economy rate, etc.
  
  2) Best Playing XI (In a given season, all teams combined) : The application will analyze the performance of all players across all teams and all years and generate a recommendation for the best overall playing XI. The output will be based on various performance metrics such as batting average, bowling average, strike rate, economy rate, etc.
  
  3) Prediction for the best Daily Fantasy Team : The application will analyse the performance of all players across the 2 teams of an upcoming match using fantasy points available on the fantasy.iplt20 page, and generate a recommendation for the best playing XI. The team will consist of players from both teams, and captain, vice-captain, based on performance.
